# Empowerly
Empowerly’s goal is to make learning about social justice engaging and approachable for all. Whether it is used in a classroom setting to provide education for youth or played in an everyday environment to provide more context to events currently happening in society and events that have happened in the past.

We have created two games. Each game has three levels - Easy, Medium and Hard.
1. Words For Change - Words for Change is a drag and drop scramble game where the objective is to unscramble a set of letters to create a word or phrase that relates to social justice. With varying difficulties, challenge yourself on your knowledge of social justice and its impact on today’s society.

2. Conscious Connections - Conscious Connections is a memory card matching game where the objective is to match the cards with the same face of a person who has made a meaningful impact on the fight for social justice.
